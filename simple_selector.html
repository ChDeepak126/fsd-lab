        The Power of curiosity
    </h2>
    <p id="curious">
      Curiosity pushes us to explore beyond what we already know. It encourages questions, sparks new ideas, and leads us to unexpected discoveries. 
      When we stay curious, learning becomes more exciting, and the world feels full of possibilities

    <h3>Embracing Change</h3>
    <pre class="change">
        Change can feel uncertain, but it often opens the door to growth. When we adapt and remain open-minded, we discover strengths we didn't know we had. 
        Every new experience teaches us something valuable and helps shape who we become.
